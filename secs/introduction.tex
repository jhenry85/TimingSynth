If $p$ is prime and $g,h \in {\mathbb Z}_p^*$, we write $\log_g(h) = n$ if $n \in {\mathbb Z}$ satisfies $g^n = h$. The problem of finding such an integer $n$ for a given $g,h \in {\mathbb Z}^*_p$ (with $g \neq 1$) is the \emph{Discrete Log Problem}.

\begin{conjecture} There does not exist a polynomial time algorithm to solve the Discrete Log Problem. \end{conjecture}
