\section{Introduction}

The \textit{bounded integer parameter synthesis problem} from ~\ref{DBLP:journals/corr/BezdekBHBC14}, is defeined as follows:
Given a parametric timed automaton $\mathcal{M}$, a labelling
function $\mathcal{L}$, an LTL property $\phi$, a lower bound function $lb$ and an upper bound
function $ub$, compute the set of all parameter valuations $v$ such that $(M, v,L) \models \phi$ and $lb(p) < v(p) < ub(p)$.
However, in the context of embedded systems, the bounds $lb$ and $ub$ must be taken from the manufacturer.
If the mafucatureer is not able to provide such bounds, or we do not want to take these as an assumptions, we need to synthesize these bounds instead.

For this reason, we formulate the \textit{integer bound parameter synthesis problem}.
Here we will try to synthesis the parameters
Given a parametric timed automaton $\mathcal{M}$, a labelling function $\mathcal{L}$, an LTL property $\phi$, 
find a lower bound function $lb$ and an upper bound $up$ such that $\forall v.\ lb(p) < v(p) < ub(p).\ (M, v,L) \models \phi$ and $min(\Sigma_{0->p}.\ ub{p}-lb(p)$.

If $p$ is prime and $g,h \in {\mathbb Z}_p^*$, we write $\log_g(h) = n$ if $n \in {\mathbb Z}$ satisfies $g^n = h$. The problem of finding such an integer $n$ for a given $g,h \in {\mathbb Z}^*_p$ (with $g \neq 1$) is the \emph{Discrete Log Problem}.

\begin{conjecture} There does not exist a polynomial time algorithm to solve the Discrete Log Problem. \end{conjecture}
